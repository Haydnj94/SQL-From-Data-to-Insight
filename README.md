# New York Airbnb Listings (2019) - Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project explores New Yorkâ€™s 2019 Airbnb listings, analyzing rental prices, neighborhood trends, and other key insights. We use a combination of SQL, Python (Pandas), and Web Scraping to process and enrich the dataset, adjusting for inflation and providing a comprehensive view of Airbnb rentals across different neighborhoods.

## Dataset

## Key Features & Methods

1. Database Management with SQL
	â€¢	Created an Airbnb database from the dataset.

	â€¢	Adjusted 2019 prices for inflation (2019â€“2025) for better accuracy.
	â€¢	Computed average rental prices for each neighborhood.

4. Python Data Processing
